# Competition-Preparation
I've done my work with developing a competition preparation script, here you can see the results.

## What
This script creates various things a organizer might need for a competition:
- competitor groupings
- scrambling list for all events and rounds (except FMC)
- nametags
- scoresheets for first rounds
    
### System information: 
This script was tested on Mac OS 10.13.4 with python 3.5.2
Please be aware, that you need Chrome to be installed on your device.
    
## How
Make sure to add all event information in the 'Manage events' tab for your competition on the WCA website. To run the script, type into your terminal 'pyton scoresheets.py' and follow the steps shown in the window.

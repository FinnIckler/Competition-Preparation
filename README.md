- nametags, option to write grouping and scrambling for each event on the back (two-sided nametags)
- registration file for check-in
- create PDF-schedule from WCA website information
- scoresheets for first rounds
- scoresheets for consecutive rounds
- blank scoresheets (with editable competition and round name)

# Competition-Preparation Redux

This is the forked version of Linus Fresz' Competition Preparation Tool, 
it maintains most of the functionality but doesn't give the users as much freedom 
in the parameter, instead it chooses the most sensible ones.

The codebase is also in the process of being modernized

## Content
This script creats various things an organizer needs to have for a competition:
- competitor groupings (specified by the amount of groups set on the WCA competition website)
- scrambling list for all events and rounds (except FMC)
- nametags, option to write grouping and scrambling for each event on the back (two-sided nametags)
- registration file for check-in
- create PDF-schedule from WCA website information
- scoresheets for first rounds
- scoresheets for consecutive rounds (using results from cubecomps)
- blank scoresheets (with editable competition and round name)
    
### System information: 
This script was tested on Mac OS 10.13.4/10.14.1 with python 3.7.1
    
## Setup
